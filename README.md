hi there !! my name is plantie, but feel free to call me shomething else. i'm really lucky, being able to know the coding language python. but now, i'm
working on opensourcing my python projects to teach, inspire, and help people understand what coding is, and how it can be used. so, basically, you can use 
MY CODING PROJECTS in python, to learn more about this awesome programming language. well, i'm so glad you chose to learn PYTHON !!! ˎˊ-
